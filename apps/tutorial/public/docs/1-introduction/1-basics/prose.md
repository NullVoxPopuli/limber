Welcome to this interactive Glimmer/Ember tutorial.
Through these pages, you'll learn how to be effective and proficient in the reactivity, syntax, and component patterns that Ember and Glimmer provide.

This is an unofficial set of tutorials and is maintained by the community.
The [official guides][ember-guides] provide an excellent [tutorial][ember-tutorial] for building a real app, starting from scratch.

The format of this tutorial is _heavily_ inspired by the [Svelte tutorial][svelte-tutorial].

### Glimmer

Glimmer is a family of utilities for making "fast and light components for the web".
It consists of the novel reactivity system and primitives, a component library, and a renderer for those primitives.
[Website][glimmer-home] here.

### Ember

Ember is "A framework for ambitious web developers", and builds on top of Glimmer, providing additional app/SDK abstractions for reducing the menial differences between apps. It consists of a well integrated test framework, router, state-management, tutorials, thorough documentation, and incremental improvements to help not leave the ecosystem behind as JavaScript evolves.

### Limber

Limber is a [REPL][wiki-repl] that aims at providing an easy way to share code examples, samples, and reproductions for both the GlimmerJS (`.gjs`) file format as well as interactive documentation authoring via mixing in GlimmerJS on top of markdown.

## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial focuses on GlimmerJS, the syntax, and concepts needed to maximize productivity.
It'll be necessary to have a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

The tutorial includes mini exercises that are designed to demonstrate various features and patterns.
The later chapters in the tutorial build upon the knowledge acquired in the earlier chapters,
so it is recommended to progress sequentially from the beginning to the end.
The dropdown menu above can be used for navigation if needed.

Each tutorial chapter includes a 'Show me' button that can be used if you encounter difficulties.
However, manually typing in the editor for each example is a more effective way to learn and enhance your skills -- but also there is no shame in asking for help!

On smaller screens, there is a button in the bottom right of the screen so that slides the tutorial text out of the way so that the editor can be interacted with.

<p class="call-to-play">
  Callouts like these will be present in tutorials to guide focus, and be clear about what you're expected to do in a particular exercise.

## What are components?

Components are a meta-building block which packages the native primitives, allowing for easier re-distribution of a specific configuration of those primitives.
The primitives in Glimmer/Ember are:

- Values (aka cells aka signals)
- Resources
- Functions
- Modifiers
- Elements


A component may include 1 or more of these primitives and is "invoked" with angle-brackets, e.g.: `<MyComponent />`

## What if I'm not using `<template>` syntax in my projects yet?

If you're an existing ember/glimmer user and are not yet using `<template>`, there is a transformation you can do to adapt the examples in this tutorial to the pre-`<template>` times by using the following guidelines:

- For any lone `<template>`, this is a template-only component.
- For any `<template>` within a `class`, this would be equivalent to a js + hbs component (two-file, colocated, or class component).
- For any files with multiple `<template>`s in them, they will need to be multiple components.
- Any reference to a local variable without `this` will need to be defined or aliased within a class component (this is supported since `ember-source@3.25` and looks like this:

  ```js
  // app/components/my-demo.js
  // ...
  import Something from 'somewhere';

  let definedInModuleSpace = () => {};

  export default class MyDemo extends Component {
    definedInternally = () => {};

    // the aliases, read as: [localClassProperty] = value;
    definedInModuleSpace = definedInModuleSpace;
    Something = Something;
  }
  ```

  ```hbs
  {{! app/components/my-demo.hbs }}

  {{#let (this.definedInternally) as |result|}}
    <this.Something @foo={{this.definedInModuleSpace}} />
  {{/let}}
  ```

  For more information on "using anything as values", see [these docs](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/rendering-values/)


## Why does the tutorial use `cell`?, I'm not using that in my projects.

Not to worry!, `@tracked` is not going away. `cell`s are a fundamental primitive of reactivity as no reactive state can exist without them.  

Whether the reactive system be [Signals][Signals], [Runes][Runes], or [`@tracked`][tracked], all systems rely on **the access or setting of properties on an object**. 

`cell`s came about as a means to take the behavior of `@tracked` and use it _anywhere_. In fact, `@tracked` could even be thought of as abstracting away a `cell` where the **access or setting of properties** occurs on the `this` object. 

Once the tutorial gets to class-components, those will be the primary form of examples going forward, as Ember has solved class ergonomics in JavaScript, and the experience using classes is quite good.
However, because there are a number of more foundational concepts to cover, this tutorial does not _start_ with classes, so that the focus of each chapter can be the foundational concepts, rather than also learning class syntax.

**Make Note**, it is typically bad practice to store state at the _module-level_ in production applications. (but doing things proper can be a distraction from teaching concepts).  
**For Library Authors** (and folks authoring library code in apps), the API of a `cell` should not be exposed to your users (as both input and output) as it is an implementation detail.

## How do I get started with a bleeding-edge Ember app today?

- For Vite 
  ```bash
  npx ember-cli@latest new my-app \
    --blueprint @ember/app-blueprint \
    --pnpm
  cd my-app
  pnpm start
  ```
  Or try it out a starter project on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nullVoxPopuli/polaris-starter/tree/main?file=README.md)
