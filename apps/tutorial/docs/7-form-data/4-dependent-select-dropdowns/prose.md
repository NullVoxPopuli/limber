The interface consists of two select dropdowns. The first dropdown contains a list of options that a user can choose from. Upon selecting an option from the first dropdown, the second dropdown dynamically adjusts its options based on the user's selection.

For instance, if the user chooses "People" from the first dropdown, the options in the second dropdown will dynamically update to show relevant choices related to "People." Similarly, if the user selects "Planets" from the first dropdown, the options in the second dropdown will change to display choices associated with "Planets."
