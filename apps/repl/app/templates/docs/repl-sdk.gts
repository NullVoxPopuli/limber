    <h1>repl-sdk</h1>

    <p>
      The repl-sdk is a singleton <em>per</em> window.


      There is a <code>Compiler</code> class that has two responsibilities, once configured.

      Those two responsibilities:
      <ul>
        <li>render *something* based on the input (text + format)</li>
        <li>(optionally) create an editor with syntax highlighting, folding, etc</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
