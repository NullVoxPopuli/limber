# Because C.I. jobs could expose secrets to malicious pull requsets,
# GitHub prevents (by default) exposing action secrets to pull requests
# from forks.
#
# This is great, however, the jobs that use the secrets are still useful on 
# pull requests.
#
# To run a _trusted_ workflow, we can trigger it from an event from an _untrusted_
# workflow. This keeps the secrets out of reach from the fork, but still allows
# us to keep the utility of pull request preview deploys, browserstack running, etc.
# Normally, this _trusted_ behavior is offloaded by Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, etc
# -- their own workers are trusted and can push comments / updates to pull requests.
#
# We don't want to use their slower (and sometimes paid) hardware.
# When we use our own workflows, we can re-use the cache built from the PR 
# (or elsewhere).
#
# To be *most* secure, you'd need to build all the artifacts in the PR,
# then upload them to then be downloaded in the trusted workflows.
# Trusted workflows should not run any scripts from a PR, as malicious
# submitters may tweak the build scripts.
# Since all build artifacts are for the web browser, and not executed in 
# node-space, we can be reasonably confident that downloading and testing/deploying 
# those artifacts does not compromise our secrets.
