## Security

Many developers know that evaluating runnable user input is a huge security risk.
To mitigate risk, this library should not be used in an environment that has access to
sensitive data. Additionally, end-users of this library (users of the consuming app) should
be made aware of the risk so that they themselves do not paste foreign / unrecognized /
untrusted code into the REPL.

This library itself will stay as up to date as possible, and if there are any security concerns,
please email security [at] nullvoxpopuli.com
