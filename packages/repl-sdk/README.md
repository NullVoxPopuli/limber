# REPL SDK

A Runtime compiler for anything that you could want to build a lighting fast REPL with.


Features:
- Uses [es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims)
- Built in support for JavaScript, Mermaid, React, Vue, Svelte, Ember, Markdown
  - On-Demand Runtime: only pay for what you compile for - the async APIs mean that your users only load what they need.
- Supports nested languages (for markdown) 
- Add any additional compiler/renderer at any time -- the flexible API allows for new libraries/frameworks to be added easily
